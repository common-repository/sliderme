== Description ==

Slider.me is the ultimate free slideshow plugin for WordPress.

In typical WordPress fashion slider.me comes with minimal zen like CSS making it dead easy to customize, it is responsive and will work with any WordPress theme. What differentiates slider.me from other slider Plugins is a bais to WordPress coding standards and a love affair with the official WordPress underscores.me theme framework.

Site owners can add various content types to their slider (i.e. images, slides or posts), and can choose from a number of pre-bundled layouts providing the site owner control over how slides are displayed.

Not only does slider.me come with various settings that allow you to control every aspect of your slide show BUT theme creators will enjoy a tidy code base meaning that virtually anything is possible.

Slider.me is based on FlexSlider2 and has been designed to target underscores.me powered themes.

slider.me integration for the WordPress e-Commerce Plugin is coming soon.
